# Design notes

Tunable values and typesetting rules. Decisions that are hard to reverse live in `docs/adr/`; these are
constants and rules we expect to adjust from measurements.

## Type scale (LP3: 1080×1240, density 480 → 360 dp wide; panel ~419 ppi)

1 sp = 3 px ≈ 0.52 pt on the panel. Column = 360 dp − 2 × 20 dp margins ≈ 165 pt. Literata averages
about half an em per character. Sizes stay in **sp** so the system large-text setting scales the Reader.

| Step | sp | ≈ pt | ≈ chars/line | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 17 | 8.8 | 38 | |
| 2 | **20** | 10.3 | 33 | **default**: first step above 30 cpl, where hyphenation stops being constant |
| 3 | 24.5 | 12.6 | 27 | measured 26 on hardware |
| 4 | 30 | 15.5 | 22 | |
| 5 | 36 | 18.5 | 18 | large print |

At 20 sp a Page holds about 13 lines (40–60 words of dialogue-heavy text, a turn every 10–15 s at
230 wpm), so vertical space is precious: side margins 20 dp, top and bottom margins 12–16 dp, no footer
while reading. Line height 1.35 with `LineHeightStyle(Center, Trim.None)` (the trim setting is what
stops descenders leaking across Pages); verified leak-free on the LP3, where 1.4 was the fallback. All
of these live in `Typesetting.kt`.

Reader is locked to portrait (`orientation = "portrait"` in `tool/lighttool.toml`), like LightOS
itself: its main activity declares the same portrait `screenOrientation`, so its tools never rotate
mid-use, and LightOS gives users no rotation control to stop a flip. Android letterboxes a
portrait-locked app whenever its area is shorter than it is wide; the LP3 has 5 dp of margin
(365 × 360 dp), the same limit LightOS's own UI lives within. The emulator must use gesture navigation
to match (a three-button bar leaves 341 × 360 dp and pillarboxes Reader).

## Page-break rules (pure, property-tested)

- A Page may end only at a line whose break falls at whitespace or a paragraph end, which rules out
  soft-hyphen breaks ("trou-/ble") and hard-hyphen compounds ("well-/known"). Defined on the source
  text, not on layout internals.
- A Page never ends on a heading; the heading moves to the next Page with its text.
- Guard: those rules give way if the Page would fall below 70% full. Consecutive hyphenated lines (a
  cascade) are an explicit test case.
- No widow or orphan rules in v1. At 26–38 characters per line most paragraphs are one to three lines,
  so the rules would fire constantly and cost a line each time.

These rules govern Pages packed forward from the Place; Pages packed backward (reached by turning back
past the Place of the current pass) follow only the fit rule (ADR 0007).

## Paragraph indent

A paragraph gets a first-line indent only when it follows another paragraph (Standard Ebooks' p + p
convention); the first paragraph after a heading, caption or verse, or a chapter's first block, starts
flush, judged on block kinds, never on window boundaries.
